# 10: Conda, Dask, Pangeo

UW Geospatial Data Analysis

David Shean  

We made it to Week 10! No formal assignment this week, so please use the time to work on your final projects. 

During class, we will discuss conda and the simple steps needed to migrate from the course Jupyterhub to your local computer.

We will also explore options to scale processing for larger datasets and more complex workflows using Dask for distributed computing and see some examples from the Pangeo project.

## Environment setup

### conda
* [Conda overview](../../resources/conda.md)
* conda vs. pip
* mamba
* conda-forge channel
* Python site-packages

### Migrating from course Jupyterhub
* [Notes and instructions](../../resources/jupyterhub_migration.md)



## Distributed processing
### GNU parallel
### Python multiprocessing

### Dask
* https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array-best-practices.html
* https://gallery.pangeo.io/repos/pangeo-data/pangeo-tutorial-gallery/dask.html

#### pandas
* Split up huge DataFrame into chunks
* https://examples.dask.org/dataframe.html

#### dask-geopandas
* Still under development, but extends to spatial dimension
* https://dask-geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

#### xarray Dask integration

## Pangeo (http://pangeo.io/)
> "A community platform for Big Data geoscience"

Take a look at the rendered pangeo notebooks on Github (you can also clone the repo to our jupyterhub/locally if desired, or access through binder or their pangeo AWS hub).  I recommend you work through the xarray and dask notebooks in the top-level directory and the amazon-web-services/landsat8.ipynb notebook.

One thing that I forgot to mention - if you are using the pangeo hub, when you are done running notebooks, please go to **File->Shut Down**.  This will free up the node allocated to you, and stop the clock on the cloud charges.  If you forget, itâ€™s OK, your server should automatically time out and shut down, but best to be a good citizen here and avoid unnecessary resource consumption.

    * Launch on AWS hub
    * In-class demo of using Dask KubeCluster for scaleable processing

## Other Discussion topics

### Collaboration with git/Github
* forking, branches, pull requests, merging

### Licenses

* Recommendation, keep it simple - BSD or MIT
* Creative Commons

### Data and code archiving
* Zenodo and other options for publishing repos
