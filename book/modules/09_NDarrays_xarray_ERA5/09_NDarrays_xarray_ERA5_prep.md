## Overview
This week, we are going to cover xarray and nDarray analysis, which could be considered "raster time series" analysis. We will analyze samples of ERA5 climate reanalysis data to explore global climatology and hourly meteorological data for WA state.

See the demo and download notebooks for introduction and lists of resources (to be added here soon).
